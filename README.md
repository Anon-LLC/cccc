I. Introduction

Modern fraud is highly organized and has structure, from the theft of data to fraud committed with the stolen data, to the cash out and laundering process. There are complex networks of criminals who do not know each other in person, but are able to work together to complete a task with anonymity.

Fraud is an industry with specialists, specific roles, and involves all regions. In this series, we’ll break down how different parts of the world dominate specific roles in the fraud profession.

Operational Chain





Territorial Roles in Cybercrime - Overview

At its core, fraud is about maximizing profit while minimizing effort and risk. To achieve high-value returns, criminals target high-value victims—typically citizens of wealthier, first-world nations. An American identity, for example, yields far more profit than one from a developing country. This economic disparity creates a global division of labor within cybercrime.

In regions like Eastern Europe, where domestic targets offer little financial incentive, cybercriminals often focus on the technical side of operations: data breaches, credential harvesting, and exploitation of remote systems. In contrast, the cashout process—turning stolen data into money—often requires a physical footprint in the victim’s country, making it more practical for actors based in the West.

Over time, this has led to a loose but persistent stratification of roles: attackers in poorer nations specialize in data theft, while those in wealthier nations—or local proxies like money mules—handle monetization. These collaborations may be formal, through organized transnational gangs, or informal, involving loosely connected players exploiting the same ecosystem.

This dynamic shapes the cybercrime culture itself. Criminals tend to specialize in the roles most accessible to them. A Russian cybercriminal may grow up learning how to skim and sell stolen payment cards, while their American counterpart focuses on laundering funds or using the data to commit fraud in-person. Geography doesn’t just influence opportunity—it defines expertise. 








III. North America

In the U.S., fraud crews and money mules play a critical role; they're the ones who receive stolen money, purchase and receive stolen products, and perform the high risk street level cybercrime. Known as “Spoofers,” “Droppers,” “Runners,” and so on, they’re the last step in the chain.

This may be a single person, a gang, or someone who pays homeless people to cash stolen checks.


They receive stolen products through merchandise (Card not present) carding, use counterfeit credit cards for in-store purchases, and fence products.

TALK ABOUT THE COMM AND CARDING COMMUNITY SEPARATE

COMM QUOTE:
I avoided my family as much as possible. I locked myself in my room with my computer every minute I could. I only trusted my close friends, of which I was blessed to have many who could tolerate my moral ambiguity.















Introduction: The Cybercrime Economy Is Real
They don’t wear ski masks. They don’t need getaway drivers. And their “crew” stretches from Moscow high-rises to Miami trap houses to Shenzhen office parks. Today’s cybercriminal is part card shark, part coder, part corporate strategist.
What used to be low-level credit card fraud has evolved into a fragmented but deeply connected global economy—geographically diverse, culturally layered, and structurally resilient. This isn’t just a threat landscape. It’s a business.
This series maps that business.
We’re not looking at lone hackers or vague headlines. We’re tracing the full supply chain—fraud, hacking, logistics, insider recruitment, and cross-border collaboration. We’ll show how organized syndicates in Eastern Europe run industrial-scale identity theft operations, how American Telegram gangs mix street culture with social engineering, and how Chinese actors quietly scale high-tech payment fraud behind closed networks.
Each chapter explores a different side of the ecosystem:
The professional-grade carding circles of Russia and Ukraine


The chaotic hustle of American refunders, SIM swappers and fraudsters


The rise of scam compounds in Southeast Asia


Tools like mule services, ID markets, and “probiv” lookups


And the new reality: forums, Telegram, and global partnerships blending into one marketplace


This isn’t a deep dive into cybersecurity theory. It’s a ground-level tour through the modern cybercriminal economy—drawn from real platforms, real threat intel, and real conversations. The names have changed, but the stakes haven’t. Every breach, refund, and lookup is part of a machine, and that machine is running.
Welcome to the field manual.












They don’t wear ski masks. They don’t need getaway drivers. And their “crew” spans from Moscow basements to Miami high rises to Shenzhen office parks. Today’s cybercriminal is part card shark, part coder, part corporate strategist.

What used to be low-level credit card fraud has matured into a multi-billion dollar ecosystem—fragmented by geography, culture, and language, but united by a shared goal: extract money, stay invisible, and outpace the defense.

This article maps that underworld.

From the secretive sophistication of Eastern European syndicates to the chaotic innovation of American Telegram crews, each region brings a unique flavor to the global cybercrime business. Some move like organized crime families. Others act more like startup founders. And as physical and digital boundaries blur, their operations are no longer isolated — they are interconnected, collaborative, and dangerously efficient.

The following isn’t a threat model. It’s a snapshot of a global economy—fueled by breaches, fraud, and services you won’t find on LinkedIn. The players are real. And so are the profits.

It should be mentioned that the type of human trafficking that is involved in Asian scam compounds is frowned upon by every other breed of cybercriminal.


Maybe talk about Hackforums?









Hey! I just got your message on reddit, and that is exactly what I was hoping to get from you! A full story of your experiences and psychology. My plan for creating this full writeup of cybercrime is going to go something like this: A full and complete picture of cybercrime from a high level, I would mention brief motivations and psychology of each community. Then, I would go in depth for each community in separate articles, in a series format. For example, if I ask you some questions and you tell me your story, I would place brief notes about how this community operated at a high level, maybe include some quotes and names. Then, I would publish your full story on its own, and go super in depth for your community.

What do you think of this style?
8:14 PM

You started this chat with ⁨DimitriShulgin.95⁩

Yeah I love that idea. I think that would be ideal / really cool.

I’ll try to start putting my past together and gather the relevant memories, reflect on them and do some writing. 

In the meantime, feel free to ask me anything.
11:17 PM

Perfect. Thank you very much for this! Me and my partner have been putting a lot of time into our series, so knowledge from the originals helps a lot with our credibility. To be honest lol.

I will start thinking of some questions, I'll send you a list by tomorrow. I'll let you put your story together in the mean time.

Our series may take some time to complete fully, but we will show you what we plan to publish before we publish anything.
11:21 PM

Yesterday

Hey, I have some questions for you if you're ready
9:02 PM

Today

Hey yeah I haven’t had too much time to put the story together but you can start with questions whenever you want and I’ll try to hop in and answer them. :) 

Also would be useful to know what time zone you are in. I am EST
9:03 AM

Sure, I'm also EST.


How did you first get into hacking or cybercrime?
Was there a specific moment of influence that pushed you into it?

What were you like back then, before you joined the forums?
What kind of person were you offline?

There were many small catalyst events, each with their own distinct category that coalesced over time to form the path that I took. 

I’ll start with the first time I engaged in what I would call traditional social engineering in the context of warranty / consumer product fraud. 

I had read on a forum or seen a YouTube video or something, that you could complain to Amazon customer service about not receiving an item and get a full refund. 

I estimate I was 13 years old, which aligns well because at this point I had a debit card and I think that was the minimum age. 

So, I went to my Amazon order history and out of pure curiosity, opened an Amazon CS chat to complain about a <$3 microphone I had purchased previously. 

To my utter amazement, they gave me a refund immediately. This would have been ~2011. 

I was scared doing it, and a little scared after. I didn’t touch SE for quite a long time after this. 

Probably during that year and the year following, I got really into RATing computers. That was my ecstasy. I was so excited by the idea of “hacking” although I wouldn’t call RATing hacking nowadays. 

My motivation there was mostly stealing personal steam accounts, Minecraft accounts, any passwords I could steal from browsers and just fuck around. I also thoroughly enjoyed just screwing with people and watching them freak out on their web cam. A bit evil…. lol. 

This trend continued from 14-16 very heavily on RATing and the social engineering was really picking up ages 15-17. 

17 is when I committed ALL of the very major SE that I did. 

That was a bit long but I think briefly describes the contributing factors that led me where I went. It wasn’t easy to say a single moment that turned me over.
———- 

What was I like? Well, unfortunately I was growing up in an extremely conservative Christian household. I was sent to a tiny little Christian school and I went there for the entirety of my K-12 education, which was absolute hell for me. 

I was in general a really good kid, very empathetic and curious, but with divorced parents and unstable households. I was interested in so many things. 

Putting my computer ambitions to the side, I also deeply enjoyed chemistry, which was probably the 2nd most interesting thing I was getting into at the time. I was also particularly interested in making anything that burns bright or explodes…. Of course. 

I synthesized potassium nitrate from ammonium nitrate and potassium chloride as precursors. Used it to make gunpowder with sulfur and charcoal. 

I’d do lots of experiments, synthesized some sodium acetate too. I also remember melting potassium nitrate and dropping a piece of candy in it and watching it turn into an exploding fiery reaction. Good times.

I had a bunch of glassware and lab equipment in my basement where I did these experiments. This started when I was 11-12.

Just to pause for a sec, I’m covering a pretty small amount here, but this is mostly to answer your question about the earliest experiences I can remember. The real crazy shit I did was mostly 16-17.
5:46 PM

That's really interesting. We share an almost completely similar path. So you had to hacker mindset when you were very young, would you describe it as a natural mindset?
5:49 PM

Sure would. I think a big contributor is I really clinged to the idea that I was the smart kid. People loved to tell me how smart I was which only made me want to be more so, to impress. It became part of my identity. 

That being said, regardless of people calling me smart, I derived a lot of enjoyment from doing the activities, even the ones I didn’t tell anyone about. 

I became a tinkerer with pretty much anything that piqued my interest.





When you were young did you think of yourself as a rebel? Did you have a lot of friends and support from your real life community?

This one is sensitive, if I'm prying too much just tell me
5:53 PM

I am super open so feel free to ask literally anything. I’ve had to overcome my religious / conservative traumas and debilitating social anxiety and as a result I became more open than most people are. Nothing is off the table, for real.

Yes, once I got to a certain age I felt my rebellion and identified with it as well. Deeply.
5:55 PM

Great. I think it's important to understand what makes a hacker, and what makes them choose their path.
5:55 PM

+1

I did have a lot of friends too

But within a really insular community
5:55 PM

When you got older, what was your role in your community? When you started getting into the forums. Were there stages or a role in a hierarchy that you wanted to accomplish?
5:56 PM

When you said community, were you also referring to the forums or real life?
5:57 PM

The forums, once you joined.

And did you have any specific responsibilities?
5:58 PM

Got it. This is something I’ve been thinking about since you reached out. 

There wasn’t too much of a hierarchy or at least one I participated in, because the vast majority of the SE I participated in wasn’t exactly a team sport. 

The only cooperation that really mattered was sharing information.

Which companies are vulnerable to which attacks, etc. Details on steps to take to perform a specific SE, more general SE tactics and such

And also the sharing of digital resources such as photoshop templates for receipts and other things.

Truthfully, the 2nd most important function of the forums was simply to brag and show off what you could do.
6:00 PM

Which forums were you a member of? Did you move up the ranks of any?
6:01 PM

SocialEngineered.net

I don’t know that I had any “rank” it’s been a long time. But I was definitely making a name for myself.

Although I will say I was the more selfish type. As I collected new methods I chose not to share often because I wanted to capitalize on them more myself.
6:03 PM

What was the original goal of SE.net? Did you see it as a place of business, a movement, or just a hangout?
6:03 PM

Well, I likely found it through hack forums which I was more involved in, in my younger years. RATing and cracking Minecraft accounts with user:pass combo lists and proxies was more my thing until I found social engineering

Once I found it, I just started engaging in the activities. It was like a whole new world for me. I loved the idea of SE. 

I saw it as an amazing resource, and also a way to revel in other people’s success
6:05 PM

Were you proud of your community? Protective?
6:07 PM

I wouldn’t say protective. I think if we had done more activities as a team I might have felt that way, then again if anyone ever got busted the only response would have been fear. 

I’m not sure if I was really proud of the other people, but I was definitely impressed. 

So I wanted to impress them too.
6:08 PM

Was there ever a shift in the type of people who started coming into the community? From geeks to full on fraudsters. Or did you consider yourself and your community fraudsters from the start?
6:10 PM

I think the vast, vast majority of users on SEnet were just teenagers like me. Once in awhile you’d see someone who seemed a lot more pro, and you could tell they were an adult. As an example, I remember a picture posted of a stack of iPhone boxes in their house. Certainly seemed like something only an adult would have out in the open in their home.
6:11 PM

What did you think of these people? Did you respect them, or resent them? Did you understand what they were doing?
6:13 PM

Yeah I’d say we all understood each other. We all did the same things with roughly the same motivations and philosophy. We all wanted to profit, and we all said fuck the corpos (funny philosophy for teenagers who never experienced the real world). 

We didn’t care about taking a tiny amount from big corps. That was the main cohesive philosophy. 

But I think if everyone really wasn’t lying to themselves, we did it for the thrill most of all. Escapism and excitement.

Beyond that not many personal feelings were developed. Most people like myself worked on our own and only communicated when looking for information. There was socializing on the forums but limited.
6:15 PM

Were you aware of the carding community?
6:16 PM

Totally aware yes. That was considered another level of fraud and SEnet was mostly people looking to avoid crime that had a lot of attention. 

One of the benefits of SE is that it was relatively unheard of.
6:16 PM

What do you mean by another level of fraud? Was there a line that you and other SE.net members would not go past? Or did you not fully understand this type of fraud?

I personally remember people disliking carders, but at the same time they didn't understand it
6:18 PM

I think it was pretty well understood in general. You could buy fullz (dump of CC holder’s information) and use that to commit card fraud by either using it online or by encoding it to a card yourself. 

It was easy to see that it was a well known and high risk form of fraud though

Whereas SE there is always some level of plausible deniability in a way. I guess

Carding was brought up quite a bit on SEnet but was officially against the rules
6:20 PM

As we hit a pause here, I wanted to quickly jot down the most significant criminal experiences I have been part of so you can ask me about them later: 

The simple, but most effective and profitable SE method I used and led to my demise. 

HOW I got caught doing said method. 

B&E / drop addresses

The times I ran from police 

How I laundered money for an anonymous individual on the darknet. 

How myself and my entire family got doxxed and I was blackmailed to give SEd items / cash to an individual or risk being reported to the police.

The most unethical SE I ever did. 

How SE is still part of my life, though not particularly illegal and not unethical or for profit.
Edited6:31 PM

That’s if those are areas of interest for you, not a directive on what I want to talk about haha. Just throwing them out there
6:38 PM

Can you tell me about what flicked that switch? The early days of your life seemed fairly innocent. What made you take a turn into more serious crime? Did you start engaging in the more serious fraud because of something?

Sorry about the pause! I had to take a work call.
6:38 PM

nah no worries too I’m working on the side here too. 

I think while my involvement simply slowly increased over time, it was mostly a form of escapism and a way for me to have my own identity and an ego that was separate from my real life. 

Specifically, I wanted to not be in the place I was with my family, school, etc. 

I never felt safe at home. I had a stepdad who really did not get along with me and berated me over everything. I was never good enough. 

To add to this, I only ever heard about the domestic abuse of my father but never saw it myself. I was always made to feel like I would end up like him. This was while my father had one divorce after another, and I had entire families ripped away from me multiple times, never to be seen again. 

SE was my pride and solitude.

I think the more uncomfortable I felt at school and home, the more I engaged. It was euphoric and my life was pretty devoid of happiness elsewhere.
6:43 PM

Do you think you developed your own trust issues because of this lifestyle your father had? Did you start to become cynical about people, outsiders?
6:45 PM

Hm. Idk about trust issues. I was a pretty trusting person. However, I think what is more relevant is that Christianity, especially my sect, had a very demeaning view of outsiders. 

Anyone outside the Christian community was looked at with great skepticism and there was always an unconscious “you’re not Christian so I don’t really like you” vibe going on. Even in myself as a rebel, I still “believed” in the doctrine and felt these ways, even though my actions are totally contrary to the system.
6:47 PM

How did you justify what you were doing online?
6:48 PM

Basically what I said before about corporations. I simply thought of it like taking a drop of water out of a bucket. My actions felt like they had limited consequences to real world people. This is something I do not agree with anymore and have since evolved my point of view with thought experiments. 

As for stealing from individuals like I did early on RATing computers and stealing accounts - I never had a justification. And a lot of that behavior went away even when I was a teenager because I eventually realized it was very immoral. SE prevailed over this as it was an easier ethical sell. 

I have a real funny story about when I changed my mind on that lol
6:51 PM

Sure id love so hear it

To*




Sure thing. So I was doing my usual ratting routine. I made stupid videos I edited in adobe after effects that I uploaded to YouTube to get people to download my RAT. 

Things like Xbox live point generator. Spent a little time making a GUI of said fake program with Visual Studio, then used after effects in a video of me refreshing my Xbox account online showing it added points to my account etc. 

So I’d get a few downloads here and there. I stole lots of steam accounts mostly through keylogging and using a reverse SOCKS proxy to login and change the email on the account, either bypassing 2FA through SOCKS or just keylogging their email and logging into that. 



So this one time, I opened up the desktop viewer for a new connection. Saw this kid had tons of steam games. Really valuable account. I open up the webcam. See the kid just chilling there. 

I steal his account, and watch him try to login over and over. After trying to reset his password and realizing the email had changed, he freaked out.

This poor kid was SOBBING. He was so upset. After a bit I felt so bad I changed the email back to his own, and while he was still trying to login he finally realized he was getting back in. 

I literally saw this kid, still with fresh tears on his face, exclaiming “YES! YES!!” There was no audio. I was just reading lips.
6:56 PM

Since you were opening webcams while taking accounts, do you think you did this for the  chaos too? Money and chaos.
7:00 PM

Absolutely. This was part of the thrill. The fact that I could do such a thing impressed myself so much. I loved showing off to my friends too. Definitely an ego thing. It was also just really interesting overall. Like shit here I am watching this kid from thousands of miles away and they have no idea (except when they see that camera light and turn it off)
7:01 PM

Since you mentioned that you hit turning point while ratting, did you make a decision that you were more interested in money after making the kid cry?

Did you seek a personal change?
7:04 PM

It wasn’t all that linear. I didn’t completely stop ratting at that point but I cooled off on the personal theft. It definitely created a vacuum that needed to be filled though, so I’d say it contributed to me moving on to something else I found more ethically amenable.
Edited7:05 PM

Do you have any interesting stories from this time in your life? Tell me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you initially loved the chaos, became more grounded, and then it opened back up again to more serious fraud.

Does that describe what you went through?
7:06 PM

I wish it was that simple to describe. I think with how young I was, I never clinged to any particular philosophy too strongly, so again it really wasn’t linear. The above story is more a “push” in a particular direction, but wasn’t a life altering experience of conviction.

For perspective, today I would still say that stealing things from individuals was worse than the crimes I committed that were “bigger” and against corporations.
7:09 PM

Who did you trust the most in this era? Who did you avoid?
7:09 PM

I avoided my family as much as possible. I locked myself in my room with my computer every minute I could. 

I only trusted my close friends, of which I was blessed to have many who could tolerate my moral ambiguity.
7:11 PM

Were your friends mainly on the forums or offline?
7:11 PM

My real IRL friends. I did have some friends online, almost exclusively thanks to Garry’s Mod servers I played on. 

Those online friends were mostly just online friends to me, they were in their own category and didn’t see much of my real life. One or two of them heard a bit about my SE and ratting but not much,
7:12 PM

Did you value these friends more than your forum connections?

Or ever try to get them involved?
7:14 PM

Yeah. I really didn’t have any forum connections that I communicated regularly with at all.

Yes, I did get multiple of my friends involved actually

You could say I “took the bullet” when the time came though.
7:14 PM

Why did you do that? I see a lot of forums that have sort of a dog-eat-dog community mindset. Was this true for SEnet? It seems possible for this mindset to cross over into personal identity, and to make a person fine with burning bridges any and everywhere.
7:18 PM

Well, there were multiple scenarios. 

In the first scenario, I literally needed physical help hauling some massive 50lb+ WOODEN CRATES with expensive electronics in them from a drop address. 

In another scenario, a close friend did my schemes with me and we split the profit 50/50, that was the biggest example and it went on for months.
7:20 PM

Did you ever have any drama because of involving your personal friends, or inside the forums?

Any major betrayals?
7:22 PM

Yeah.. After I got caught and it became community gossip, I was effectively banned from visiting the homes of many of my friends by their parents. 

More notably though, it caused tension with the family of the person I involved in the 50/50 scheme, because his siblings and probably parents to some extent knew that I was doing bad things and being a bad influence.

It was like excommunication
7:24 PM

What do you think started the downward spiral into getting caught?
7:25 PM

Greed

Greed started it and my lack of care because of greed led to my demise 100%
7:25 PM

Was there ever a moment where you believed you were in too deep? To deep to quit?
7:26 PM

Yeah, when I got blackmailed.

I felt completely trapped
7:26 PM

Can you tell me about that?
7:26 PM

Yes. I was hanging out at a movie theatre with a friend. Got a wild text message. 

It was immediately threatening. They basically texted me saying my name, and they mentioned a specific high value item I had SEd and that I needed to call them in the next 5 minutes or they would report me.

Cue anxiety attack. I tell my friend I need to make a call and I run out of the theater and hit dial. Guy on the other end immediately starting with an extremely aggressive tone telling me what I need to do. 

He listed off my name, both my parents’ names and phone numbers, my mother’s company, everything. He knew everything. He knew my parent’s were divorced, both my addresses, family members…

So he tells me at one point I need to keep texting him every few minutes or he’s gonna report me to family and police with evidence. 

I’m absolutely panicked, and I was driving home to start working on what he was asking of me. 

I’m driving and texting at the same time, and I get pulled over for veering off. 

I played dumb with the cop, and by chance my dad sees me pulled over in town and pulls over himself and talks to the officer. I get mildly questioned about texting but I get off. 

Family was super suspicious that I was lying about texting, and I’m just trying to keep it together and get through dinner. 

I keep my comms open with the blackmailer, and I work with him

He wants money. The money I got from selling my SEd items. I told him the money was gone and I don’t remember how true that was, but I instead offered to SE the items to an address of his choosing. 

Eventually, he agrees, but still maintains his position of aggression and authority,  constantly checking in.

But then I had an idea. Why not SE the blackmailer? Fuck it.

So I slowly warm up to him. I tell him okay, you got me, I respect the hustle, and I’ll do what you say, just chill and talk to me normally, it doesn’t need to be this way. 

After a few attempts, I got him to chill out, to talk to me more like an acquaintance.

We make plans for him to receive the items etc. But I never do it. I just lead him on for awhile and keep making conversation. Eventually he was using “lol” in convos and even got him to tell me how he doxxed me and how I can protect myself. 

So then, feeling comfortable enough, I call his bluff. I block his number.

Fast forward a few weeks later, I’m on a family vacation. We just got out of a restaurant and my mother hands me her phone and says one of my buddies from community college was looking for me

As soon as I answer, it’s the guy again, screaming in my ear that I need to follow through or it’s all coming out. 

In probably my most ballsy moment, I simply say “I do not want a free Jamaican vacation, no thanks” and hang up as I’m trying to save face in front of my family.

In hindsight that was a terrible cover considering who he said he was to my mother, lmao

Never heard from him again. A big part of that SE was establishing empathy. I knew he was a young guy like myself and I established our mutual positions.
7:38 PM

That's hilarious. Were your parents tech savvy enough to uncover your double life?

For me personally I had to hide every single thing as my stepfather worked in tech, but they eventually put things together.

I learned how to hide as a result of that, for better or worse
7:41 PM

Sort of. My mother found fraudulent USPS documents I had created to try and make it seem like something got lost in the mail. 

There was literally an intervention with my family and pastor / school principal because of this, AT school

Haha yeah they never really got into my devices but they did dump my phones SMS at one point as part of the above effort
7:41 PM

What stage were you when you sent through the intervention? Were you at the peak of your career or just a kid?

Went through*
7:42 PM

I was 16 I think. Peak of my career was 17

I’m 27 now, never mentioned that
7:43 PM

This is sort of unrelated, but I saw a guy who social engineered companies by posing as Barnabus nerdgasm, the computer YouTuber. Do you know of this person?
7:44 PM

Oh boy…..
7:44 PM

Haha
7:45 PM

I don’t know him, but the big SE stuff I’ve been alluding to is exactly the same thing. Though I impersonated someone much bigger (I think)
7:45 PM

Can you tell me about your more serious adventures in fraud? When did you start getting into what you would consider serious crime. If you did.

Beyond simple scams to things that you knew were very bad
7:46 PM

One thing before I continue
7:46 PM

Sure
7:47 PM

Just need some assurance that this won’t come back to bite me in the ass. 

There are certain details I might not be comfortable being shared in an article. Nothing I’ve told you so far fits this criteria, but if there’s any reason in the future you need certain details, I may tell you for context with the disclaimer that I need those details obscured from public view

The only information you have right now that I would be uncomfortable sharing with the world is my Reddit profile, is it’s not totally clean and could be used to dox me potentially
7:48 PM

Sure, I'm not out to expose people. This article is just for getting a psychological profile. I don't have your previous username or a reason to be doxing an inactive hacker. Anything you think is sensitive just don't answer, I'll understand.
7:50 PM

+1

Psychological profile is more important to me than specific details in schemes

But specific details are also interesting to me, whichever you share



Thanks. I trust you, you seem to have good intentions. 

I will say this. You are free to share what I am about to show you in relation to my story. And if I’m being honest, this could bring a lot of attention to your article if you do want to include it.

I think this speaks for itself 😬:
https://x.com/MKBHD/status/578230153496526849

I’ll admit if you do include it, would be a bit of a spectacle to me 😂. But your article is your article and I know you have a direction to go 🙂
7:53 PM

In my article I can't include that I think that's hilarious, but that's hilarious
7:54 PM

https://barnacules.wordpress.com/2015/08/05/why-i-havent-been-making-more-videos/

Check this one out it's the same thing

I remember seeing this guy talking about SEing a mobile home, something crazy

He was a big geek too
7:56 PM

Wow. That was a blast from the past. I can’t see a date on that particular article which is too bad, I’d love to know. 

I won’t say I was the only person or the first to do the method, but it definitely wasn’t widely done when I started doing it. 

It became the “impersonation method” soon after though, I don’t think I ever shared it, but I remember hearing little things here and there and someone even using the method to get a $100K 3D printer.
7:58 PM

This was published August 5th, 2015
7:58 PM

Damn okay, 5 months after the MKBHD tweet.

He wasn’t the only one I impersonated. My head canon is that I made a lot of noise with this and then it spread, but totally possible people just started doing it organically, not like it was that complicated

The complicated part was getting the goods anonymously
8:00 PM

Can you tell me about this? For me personally, when internet activities started going into real life, thing changed for me. Using drops, doing things in person.
8:01 PM

Oh yeah, I got a lot to say about that

One thing tho, you had contact with the nerdgasm impersonator? Did he say how he started doing that method?
8:02 PM

I remember seeing this guy active on DarkPID. This forum was active probably in 2019, 2020. He did this by spoofing the barnacles domain in his email, and telling companies not to respond.

I never had direct contact but he was a popular member
8:03 PM

Ahhh okay. Interesting! Good ol email spoofing. There used to be a website you could spoof any domain it was awesome, they all went to spam but with a little SE to get people to look in Spam, it was a goldmine

Anyway back to the real life aspects of SE
8:04 PM

Haha sure
8:04 PM

So here’s a story about my pre-major SE days that acted as a catalyst to my openness to do real world things for SE, I’ll try to keep it short



It’s Halloween 2014. I told my friends I want to be the President and they can all be Secret Service agents. 


So I we all dress in suits and I’ve got a rubber Obama mask on, with a Bluetooth speaker in my pocket, while my friends are controlling an Obama soundboard connected and playing hilarious sound bytes of Obama as I approach each house for trick or treat. 

Such a great night and hilarious role play. 

So later at night we’re hanging at my house after the shenanigans, and we decide to go for a walk. 

We walk really far and end up at the town’s fairgrounds which are inactive this time of year. Bunch of random buildings, horse race track, sports field etc.

So we’re walking and someone has the great idea “we should break into the Snack Shack”. 

Friend pulls out a knife and is jimmying the door plunger and gets it open, we rush inside and steal a bunch of random shit, football, walkie talkies, snacks

This was totally unlike us. We got a massive adrenaline rush. We got so scared of a “silent alarm” (lmao) and went home which was pretty far.

This group became known as SS. Bad name in hindsight, but it stood for both Secret Service and Snack Shack. 

We started regularly doing B&E on random empty buildings to explore or commit petty theft. Somewhat frequently

Soon after I bought many different entry tools. Lockpicks mostly, and got a tool that can open any locked door that opens outwards, forgot the name.

I got REALLY good at it, I could pick pretty high quality locks quickly. Did a lot of breakins that way.

So when I started SEing items that required drop addresses, this became an invaluable skill

Any item that was expected to return or get payment for to a company was sent to a drop address to avoid any problems.

Many times the delivery drivers either wouldn’t deliver without a signature, or would actually open the door of the house / garage, put the package in and lock it

I used these skills to put shipment release forms on the inside of garage door windows, and also to retrieve packages that were locked in these houses
8:13 PM

Did you ever run into any problems with neighbors when you were visiting the houses? I would be worried about someone thinking it's a porch pirating situation.
8:14 PM

I almost exclusively did this in the pitch dark of night and wore all black clothes and snuck onto the property from behind usually

Almost always used the back door

I dropped an SD card one time when was investigated and they looked into me because of it, but it wasn’t what got me caught
8:15 PM

You dropped the SD card at a drop?
8:16 PM

Yeah sorry so I had a micro SD card in my jacket which I unknowingly dropped in the backyard of one of my drops. Didn’t know til one day I was walking back to my house in the middle of the day doing nothing and saw a police cruiser in my driveway

I immediately turned around and RAN as fast as I could and waited til one of my parents called me. I knew it was for me. Just knew
8:17 PM

How do you think they found you? Do you think it was for the B&E or that you were under investigation?
8:18 PM

On the SD card was videos from my GoPro. Thankfully not of any of my crimes which I often filmed lmao. Good thing it wasn’t the OTHER SD card 😬. 

They found a clip where I was wearing a school shirt and then x-refed my face against a list of students

So they assumed whoever dropped the card was involved with a suspicious package for Marques Brownlee
8:19 PM

Dimitri Shulgin
So they assumed whoever dropped the card was involved with a suspicious package for Marques Brownlee

Lol

What were the value of things you were getting at this time?
8:21 PM

The most beastly gaming laptops that were available on the market, biggest one MSRP was $5K if I recall correctly

Origin Gaming PC is the entity that cared enough to go after me.

Marques was pissed. He emailed me, the CEO of origin emailed me…
8:22 PM

Where did you keep all of your loot?
8:22 PM

Sold it. Never sat on phat inventory with those

I always sold on eBay for like 2-300 less than MSRP for a quick sale

Selling them on eBay got me caught

Customer needed manufacturer help with BIOS or something and he gave the serial and they said it was stolen
8:23 PM

Did all of these bad things start happening at once? Companies and Marquees messaging you, the customer finding out it was a stolen product.
8:24 PM

There was considerable time between. Some months. Wasn’t another year or so before the cops called my parents and I had to lawyer up

I did something so fucked up to the guy with the stolen laptop he returned to origin though

It’s actually probably the worst thing I’ve done to someone. It was evil. 

He messaged me on eBay telling me the laptop was stolen and he had to return to them and said the police were involved… but he said the <my home state> police. Which freaked me out because at the time I was in Florida doing all this shit, I freaked

So when this happened, my PayPal was immediately -$1700, which was unacceptable because that was the money flow for me and my partner in crime. 

So… I made a fake email to the eBay guy pretending to be from Origin… I said as a gesture of good faith we will let you keep the laptop if you reverse the PayPal chargeback…

And he did…. I took $1700 from him straight up. Feel like shit about that,
8:28 PM

Did fooling this guy go further from there or make it into any court documents?
8:29 PM

Nope. That part never ended up being involved in anything legal which surprised me to say the least.

I never even had to go to court

I got indicted for just 2 laptops I stole from origin, nothing else. They never found anything else. 

I was shitting myself for an entire year with this case hanging over my head. My lawyer got it totally settled out of court and it’s a sealed record - meaning I have no criminal record.
8:31 PM

I see a lot of ex cyber criminals talking about this exact point. Victims hardly going to police. The complexities of reporting a crime from another state. Just delaying them until they throw their hands up and take the loss.

Do you think this was true for you in this or other cases?
8:32 PM

I’m not sure honestly.

One sec, taking a pic of something
8:34 PM

Sure
8:34 PM




So I guess I was never indicted, you could say
8:41 PM

Wow thanks for showing me that. Was it as this time that your parents figured out who you really were?
8:42 PM

So that letter was at the very end of the case I believe.

The timeline is super fuzzy for me. I spent what felt like an entire year just waiting for news on my case and then I got that letter.

Totally possible it was much less than a year. Most stressful year of my life.
8:43 PM

Did you stop social engineering during this period?
8:43 PM

I had already stopped social engineering for the entire time the case was going on

Which was the sad part for me. I had already exited and made my peace with leaving it behind

To add to this, all the crimes were committed while I was a minor. Because they were discovered as I was an adult, they decided to charge me as an adult, that’s what my lawyer told me.

What I meant was I had already stopped for a significant length of time before the case was opened
8:45 PM

Did you feel like you lost something that was a part of you when you had to stop?

Or did you have remorse?
8:46 PM

Yeah I was scheming to do something else! But I was too busy having a whole new world in community college which was awesome as I grew up so insulated. 

I did have remorse. But much more remorse long after the case.

I was starting to come to terms with the fact my moral paradigm was flawed. I went with the fuck corporations thing too far. 

I realized like holy shit… what about the PR person that approved my review units? They probably got fucked. I felt mostly bad about that, and obviously bad about messing with MKBHDs rep.
8:48 PM

What do you think made you do some introspection and decide that it was wrong? A girl? New friends?
8:48 PM

LSD
8:49 PM

If you could go back, would you change the way you acted?

Or do you have some pride. No judgement.
8:51 PM

I absolutely admit I have pride in it. Shame too though. 

It’s a hard question. Do I regret it? Yes. Would I change it? Not a chance.

It made me what I am today, and there’s no sense in risking who I am now or what I have today because of all of it
8:52 PM

Who are you today?
8:53 PM

That’s a big question haha
8:53 PM

It's the buildup we need to know 🤣
8:53 PM

joy

I'm super interested

I've seen a lot of people who turned whitehat, some who got completely out of tech

Some who continue

The mindset never really leaves though, I think



I guess I’m an anti-authoritative rebel who lives on their own terms and makes their own philosophy. 

I had to break down everything I knew (I really mean everything) and try to build up something new from the ground. I spent years doing this. Every day asking myself the biggest questions one can ask. 

I care so much about this world and the people. I want them to see how independent they can really be. I want them to rise out of whatever system of control they are influenced by. Not in a crazy way. 

I’m someone who deeply cares about self-advocacy, and believe the key to it is spreading awareness and the belief that we can act more independently. 

I’m also a successful(ish) software engineer, and while I’m not in cybersec, I’m always the first guy to point to the security flaws, both technical and social. 

I also like to do all the kinds of drugs, but sparingly. Psychedelics came naturally for me, and helped me build every single thing I have today. 

Breaking out of an authoritarian cult was step 1. That it did just perfect for.

I guess it’s only a glimpse into me totally, but it’s the most important aspects about myself that I care about.

I use my SE skills for political activism now.
9:01 PM

That's awesome man. If you have time to talk about it, I'd love to hear about it. How you're applying the same mindset to your current life.
9:02 PM

heart

Most recently, tracking neo nazis that have been coming to my area to spread propaganda.

I use public records and other open source intelligence tools to find where they live, spread awareness on their actions, and try to fuck with their lives to disrupt their efforts
9:04 PM

Ha that's my specialty. OSINT. It's how I found you.
9:04 PM

joy

I have a boiling anger inside me from all the childhood trauma and this is how I dump it, with care though.

How did you find me exactly?
9:05 PM

I was looking for the username Dopeland, and found your reddit comment talking about your activity
9:05 PM

Interesting so Dopeland must of commented on my post or something
9:05 PM

Yeah someone said the word dopeland on your comment and I got a hit
9:06 PM

Ohhh

It’s funny cuz I get message requests for that post all the time

Current SEers looking for tips

Even though that post is hella old now
9:07 PM

That's another good point. What do you think of these guys now? Do you follow cybercrime?
9:07 PM

I just think of them as younger me. No judgement. I don’t give them tips though, I try to convince them to stop, if anything at all

Actually did convince one guy, still talk to him once in awhile

He wasn’t too deep but was about to be lol
9:08 PM

Do you follow cybercrime activity or any forums now?

Telegram groups, carding forums
9:09 PM

Definitely. Not like super, but I definitely hear things and get interested. Darknet drama is always interesting

For one, I gotta get my drugs somehow

I follow Monero stuff, darknet stuff. Love Mental Outlaws on YT

Mental Outlaw*
9:10 PM

Do you follow the fraud side?
9:10 PM

Eh not really. I feel like not much has changed but I guess I wouldn’t know.
9:10 PM

These days the carding scene has shifted quite a bit. The communities on forums like SE.net don't exist, it's straight up fraud. It's mixed with pop culture now heavily.

It's professionals and people who want to dive straight into the really bad things

Not much finesse or geek interest anymore

Occasionally people will be the old school way, but they're old guys
9:13 PM

Yeah that’s interesting. I wouldn’t even know how they are still carding with chips and stuff now. Not asking but things must have changed a lot
9:14 PM

If you wanna see an example check out: wwh-club.to
9:14 PM

I do feel like we are on the brink of deepfake scams exploding like crazy in the next couple years. Right now it’s something that happens to an exec once in awhile

You

9:14 PM

wwh-club.is
wwh-club.work

It might be your network these domains get flagged all the time

Today the main scams are identity theft and online carding
9:16 PM

It’s good now just needed the redirect to populate /index.php
9:16 PM

Think like COVID fraud
9:16 PM

Online carding always seemed wild.  Like, you’d need a drop to send everything to. SE is one thing, but authorities probably already know it’s fraud by the time you get something

Unless they are carding digital assets
9:17 PM

That's the interesting part. It's industrialized now. There are such things as drop projects, "reshipping scams", that will hire legit people from job sites to reship packages under the guise of real work. These projects will have hundreds of miles receiving and reshipping packages.

You can see them advertising to carders on WWH.
59m

Damn.. that’s literally an idea I had back when I was doing SE

I was going to hire people through those odd job apps to do it
58m

Picture that level of professionalism with just about every other online fraud

It's bad
57m

That’s wild.
57m

I think I have enough to publish a good article unless you want to add anything. Any stories or memories you'd like to mention.

Great article*
56m

Only significant thing we didn’t cover is when I was a money mule for a darknet person.
56m

Oh yeah sure
56m

It’s pretty simple.

I found a guy advertising on a darknet forum I was just poking around. He wanted someone to withdraw cash from ATMs using a provided card, and then use the money to purchase BTC and send to him

Honestly I thought it was a scam because shit on there is riddled with it. But it ended up being legit and I couldn’t believe it
55m

Was this with skimmed cards? Where you would be encoding the dumps and then using the pins.

Or cards mailed directly from banks? Bank account takeovers.
53m

He sends me a BoA card in the mail, and my job was to withdraw money every single day and put it into BTC. I was allowed to keep 10% cash. 

So he started me at a few hundred, he wanted to make sure I wouldn’t scam him. 

Then it quickly ramped up to $1600 / day on a single card. I had no idea you could even withdraw that much in a single day at the time.

I only ever had one card and this went on for quite awhile. Honestly I’m not sure if it was a take over. But I’m pretty sure the card was mailed directly from a bank. Shipped to the Airbnb I was at

So every day I parked far away from the ATM, left my phone in the card, hat and sunglasses and did the deed

Easiest money I ever made

Left phone in the car*
51m

You used the same ATM card for all of these withdrawals?
51m

Yep

Never needed another
51m

Damn he must've opened up a bank at the address you were receiving the card, and started sending transfers to it
50m

Yeah I’m not really sure. I didn’t ask but he said it was his money, just shady money. Lol.
50m

How did that end?
50m

I got the last laugh and kept the full $1600 once I decided to exit lmao

He was only putting money in the account after every BTC payment
49m

Did that turn you onto anything? Any new schemes?
49m

Nah, that was a one and done
49m

Where did you meet this guy? On the same SE forum?
48m

Couldn’t remember the name it was an obscure forum on the darknet. Likely found it while looking for forums related to drug sales
48m

Ah ok, a different community.

There weren't many guys like this on SE.net I assume. Is that right?
47m

It was a general purpose darknet forum.

Nah not at all

Almost all teenagers I almost guarantee it
47m

Do you think this is enough to document your life well?
46m

Yeah, I think I’ve spoken enough. 🙂
46m

Cool man. Thank you again, it was really awesome to talk to you. Would you like to add your old username to the article?

I think it would look cool but that's up to you
45m

Hahahhahahaa actually I can’t, because my old username is a username I used everywhere including on personal profiles because I was a dumbass

That’s how I got doxxed

We coud make up an agreed alias

For reference purposes if that’s part of it
43m

Sure, what's a good alias for you? It should have purpose. The person you are now, coming from who you were

Something good to describe you

An animal, a color, anything

Or a variation of something old
41m

This would be really hard to explain why (and I can), but can you use 

Z3RO_SH3LL 

?

This is actually a new alias of mine, but I’ve kept it very safe from my identity.

It’s an over-the-top hackerman name I’ve been using in an online community that has a lot hackers.
40m

What would you like to be called? A social engineer, fraudster, cyber criminal, etc


Social Engineer Interview: Z3RO_SH3LL
40m

Both social engineer and cyber criminal work for me. I’ll leave it up to your creativity and whatever fits the vibe
39m

Perfect. Can I contact you if I need clarification on things? Like I said I'm doing a high level overview of cybercrime, and then I will do a deep dive on communities. We had a great conversation about your motivations and psychological profile. If I need some information like a day to day on a certain forum, could I ask you?

I think we will be finished in about 1 month

I'll show you a draft before it goes up
36m

heart

I really enjoyed dumping all this info and talking with you a lot. I also really appreciate what you are doing. 

You can absolutely reach out anytime. I’ll assume you have my Reddit user if you ever lose contact here as well.

I gotta ask too, already got a website?
36m

Great man, I appreciate it.

Our website is still being developed (we want to make sure our first content is groundbreaking before worrying about design) but it's up and working if you wanna check it out: vaultbreak.sh

Awesome! I’ll definitely keep my eye out. I know you’ll probably reach out before I see anything posted anyway, but yes thanks!
